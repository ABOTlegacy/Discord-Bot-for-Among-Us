Hello Everyone, I made a simple bot that let a single person mute everyone in the voice channel. I created because most of my friend play Among Us on ther phones so they can´t mute themself when the round starts, this bot let a single person be in control of all the voice of everyone in the voice channel, it´s simple, if the person call the "chief" mute himself, everyone is also muted.

This bot is not run in any server so you need to run it at you computer, first thing is that you need a way to run python, after that you need to get a token so you can add to the variable Token in line 5, to do that you can follow the tutorial below:

Obeservations:

- You need to start the bot in your computer before anyone enters the voice channel, or, you can just ask to everyone disconect and reconnect after you started the bot.
- The bot needs permition of Administrator, so it can mute and unmute everyone (@everyone can't be administrador) 
- Please add more observations if you find any bug and found out how to solve it
